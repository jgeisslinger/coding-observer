Welcome on my blog, Coding Observer. On this blog you can find a lot of things around coding and other tech stuff. I focus especially on Javascript and Web development as well as Microsoft PowerApps and smaller tech projects with Raspberry or Arduino. 

Happy to have you here and enjoy your readings.

In case of any questions, leave a comment or drop me an email to jo@coding.observer
