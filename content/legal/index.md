### Limitation of liability for internal content

The content of my blog has been compiled with meticulous care and to the best of my knowledge. However, we cannot assume any liability for the up-to-dateness, completeness or accuracy of any of the pages.

Pursuant to section 7, para. 1 of the TMG (Telemediengesetz – Tele Media Act by German law), I am liable for my own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. However, pursuant to sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, I am not under obligation to monitor external information provided or stored on my website. Once I have become aware of a specific infringement of the law, I will immediately remove the content in question. Any liability concerning this matter can only be assumed from the point in time at which the infringement becomes known to me.

### Limitation of liability for external links

My website contains links to the websites of third parties (“external links”). As the content of these websites is not under my control, I cannot assume any liability for such external content. In all cases, the provider of information of the linked websites is liable for the content and accuracy of the information provided. At the point in time when the links were placed, no infringements of the law were recognisable to me. As soon as an infringement of the law becomes known to me, I will immediately remove the link in question.
